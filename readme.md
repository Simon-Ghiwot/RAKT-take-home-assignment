# ðŸš€ RAKT's "Out-of-the-Box" Engineering Challenge ðŸŒŸ

## Introduction

Welcome to RAKT take home assignment, this an api endpoint given a coordinate in San Francisco return five of the nearest food trucks

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Simon-Ghiwot/RAKT-take-home-assignment.git
   cd RAKT-take-home-assignment
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv/bin/activate.bat  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Apply migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### How to Use the API (Demonstration)

1. **URL :**

   ```bash
       POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/foodtrucks/
   ```

2. **Pay load:**
   ```bash
        payload = {
            "origin_latitude" : "37.76008693198698",
            "origin_longtiude" : "-122.41880648110114"
        }
   ```
3. **Sample Output**
   ```bash
       {

## Trade off

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Haversine distance formula for calculating proximity between two geographical coordinates. The Haversine formula is commonly used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere, such as the Earth. This could have been done on the database by using proximity calculators but I wanted to use this equation because it would be a great learning exprience. The database implmentation would slightly be faster than the actual Haversine calculation.
